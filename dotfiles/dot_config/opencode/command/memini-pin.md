description: "Pin a memini memory so it surfaces in every session briefing"
---

Pin a memory so it is always surfaced in the session briefing and is exempt from
**retro-tiering demotion** (a pinned durable fact is never demoted back down a
tier when it goes unused).

Two things pinning does _not_ do, so don't promise them:

- It does not stop **confidence decay**. An unused pinned fact still loses
  confidence; pinning only spares it the demotion that would otherwise follow.
- It is not immune to the **injection token budget**. Pinned is dropped _last_,
  not never: if the pinned block alone exceeds `MEMINI_INJECT_BRIEFING_MAX_TOK`,
  its tail entries are still trimmed.

Target: $ARGUMENTS

Steps:

1. **Find it.** If the argument is a memory id, call `memory_get` with it. If it is
   a description, call `memory_recall` first and — unless exactly one result is an
   obvious match — show the candidates and ask which one. Copy the `namespace` field
   off the result verbatim; never construct one.

2. **Read its current tags.** This step is not optional. `memory_update` **replaces**
   the tag list rather than merging into it, so passing `tags: ["pinned"]` would
   silently delete every other tag the memory has.

3. **Call `memory_update`** with the id, its namespace, and `tags` set to the
   existing tags **plus** `"pinned"`. Preserve the original order and do not add
   `"pinned"` twice if it is already there — say it was already pinned and stop.

To **unpin**, do the same but pass the existing tags _minus_ `"pinned"`.

Then tell the user what is now pinned, and warn them if the pinned set is getting
large: the briefing's pinned budget defaults to 5 (`MEMINI_INJECT_BRIEFING_PINNED`),
so pinning more than that means some pins stop surfacing, and which ones drop is
not something the user chose. Pins are for durable identity and preferences, not
for anything merely important.
